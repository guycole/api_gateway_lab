### AWS API Gateway Experiment

Demonstrate features of [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway).

This repository contains a [swagger](http://swagger.io) file which creates an API Gateway that interacts w/a simple PHP example.  As a simple passthrough example, we can focus on the different stages/transformations that API Gateway performs.

## Installation

*  Deploy the PHP script (I use a EC2 instance).
  * Verify the PHP script is working by invoking from a browser or curl(1).

* Next step
